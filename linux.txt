Linux Commands:
Operating System:
    -- OS works with CPU
    
CLient OS vs Server OS:
    -- client, an OS made for individual, private user
        -- EG: Win 11, Mac OS

    -- Server OS works for mutliple users
        -- EG: RHEL, Win Server 2022 

Linux OS:
    -- windows is GUI based
    -- Mac is made upon UNIX Enterprise (shell based)
    -- Linus while working on UNIX created Linux
    -- aws due to its scalable nature, names elastic

Linux Working:
    -- linux core is its kernel, through shell
    -- kernel is written in C, that talks to hardware

    Shell:
        -- command is written on shell, its tranlation is forwarded to kernel, and kernel talks to hardware
        -- shell command, list is shell scripting,  
        -- sh standard, bash borne again (p), csh corn , zsh, fish are all types
        -- / is known as root directory

    Sudo:
        -- Its a group that has super user permission

    systemctl:
        -- tool that controls installed services

Pacakge Manager:

    apt:
        -- application package manager that ubuntu uses
        -- RHEL uses yum, dnf

    apt update:
        -- fetches packages

    apt upgrade:
        -- downloads packages

VIM:

    vim file_name:
        -- open / create a file

    i:
        insert mode

    esc:
        -- escape to come out of a mode
        
    :wq: 
        -- w -write, q -quit

    :qa!:
        -- if a file is readme only the use sudo with vim - sudo vim index.html
        -- quit without saving


Directory Structure:

    var:
        -- variable information like cache, logs

    tmp:
        -- temporary folder, any user can access
        -- its green bcz any one can acesss

    mnt:
        -- mount storage and devices

    home:
        -- where users are placed

    sbin:
        -- system level binary files are stored here
        -- machine convert commadn to binary 0,1
        -- blue for system level

    root:
        -- root is super user

    media:
        -- images and others

    etc:
        -- all configs stay here
        
    boot:
        -- system run program in ram, to start os

        grep -i "search_this" first.txt:
            -- -i is for case unsensitive

        awk '/nginx/ {$1="sudo"; print $1, $2, $3}' ./documentation/linux.txt
            -- Pattern Matching → /nginx/ ensures only lines containing "nginx" are processed.
            -- Field Replacement → $1="sudo" correctly replaces the first column.
            -- Correct Print Statement → print $1, $2, $3 prints the modified first three fields.

            -- Keeps awk logic intact → $1="sudo" modifies the first field and prints selected fields.
            -- Ensures correct piping → sed processes only the printed fields, not the full original line.
