Networking:

How does the internet work:
    -- data transfer through optical fiber cables
    -- Teir 1 Companies buy these cables    
    -- Tier 2 companies rent these, the create data packs for others to access internet
    -- Tier 3 companies rent above, then give internet services

    WAN : Wide Area Network : T2
    MAN : Metropolitan (City) Area Network : T3
    LAN : Local (House) Area Network 
    PAN : Personal (Bluetooth) Area Network 

OSI Model & TCP/IP model:

    OSI (Open System Interconnection):
        -- It has seven layers: Theory how internet works
        -- Application
        -- Presentaion
        -- Session
        -- Transport: Protocols like TCP, UDP
        -- Network
        -- Data Link
        -- Physical
    
    TCP/IP Model:
        -- it has 4 layets: Practical how internet works:
        -- Application [App, Pre, Sess]
        -- Transport
        -- Internet [Network]
        -- Network [Physical, Data Link]

    Protocol (Rules):
        Application Layer:
            -- HTTPS [Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure]
                -- I want to use HTTPS protocol to access web

            -- SMTP [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]
                -- Rule used for sending email

            -- FTP [File Transfer Protocol]
                -- rule to forending files over web

        Transport Layer:
            -- TCP [Transmission Control Protocol]
                -- Video transitting from server to client (uploaded video)
                -- Without frames drop and lag
                -- already on the server
            -- UDP [User Datagram Protocol]
                -- streaming, maybe some lag (video streaming)
                -- with frames drop and lag, packet drops
                
        Internet Layer:
            -- IP [Internet Protocol]
                -- used to bring internet to laptop mobile
                -- my public IP address (Home Network)
                -- it was made to give access to devices
                -- if we want to give access to people, we use IPV4 or IPV6

                Types:
                    -- IPV4 Address:
                        -- These are upto 400 Crores +

            -- Subnet:
                -- Our own served internet is a subnet with IPV4

            -- VPC: [Virtual Private Cloud]
                -- If we are using aws VPC

            -- VPN: [Virtual Private Network]
                -- Access web blocked by college 

        Network Layer:
            -- wifi on, to connect to Internet

What is IP & MAC Address:
    -- IP is the device address on internet level
    -- IP changes if connected to other wifi
    -- When we block a device on a wifi, we block it using MAC address
    -- MAC identifies our device on LAN, wheras IP identifies on WAN

Routers & Switches:
    Routers:
        -- Routing outisde network to our device to access internet
        -- connect to WAN

    Switch:
        -- similar to hotspot, to connect devices
        -- connect to LAN

    ISP:
        -- isp provides network to home using router
        -- in order to connext internet using my pc to mobile

Firewalls, Ports & Protocols:

    Routes:
        -- These are routes 

    Ports:
        -- If we wan to enable HTTP protocol on our laptop then we have to enable ports like port 80
        -- For Https we enable port 443 
        -- For MySQL enable port 3306

    Onpremise:
        -- infrastructure on individual level like laptop
        -- Or a server room with storage units, switches

    Cloud:
        -- Data server , Aws global infrastructure
        -- server, instance aws, virtual machine azure, compute engine gcp

    SSH: [Secure Shell | Secure Socket Shell]
        -- Network protocol that allows two computers to connect
        -- .pem uses OpenSSH tool


Client-Server Architecture:
    -- clint connects to server using ssh
