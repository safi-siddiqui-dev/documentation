Methadology:
    Agile:
        -- Requirement is tasked, work is developed with iterated with tests, until deployed

    Waterfall:
        -- Cannot move to second task unless first task is not completed
    
Scrum:
    -- Creating task in todo, then moving from progress, testing, done

    Sprints:
        -- These are assgined to a task to be done in a given time
        -- Sprints have goals to achieve
        -- Sprints also have points

Kanban:
    -- board representation, same as Scrum, task are given
    -- we dont see a timeline for a task

Epic:
    -- Goal we have to achieve, main title

Story:
    -- Description of goal for a person

    Story Points:
        -- Difficulty / Time Taken
        -- 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
        -- 1 is easy, 2 is normal, 3 is medium
        -- 5 is a week, 8 is 2-3 weeks, 13 is for a month


Task:
    -- Apply, Create or update the code
    -- Steps, process, how i can achieve the goal
