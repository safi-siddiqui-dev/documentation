Basics:
    git init
        -- initialise a git repo

    git branch -M main
        -- set main branch as "main", common convention

    git remote add origin https://github.com/safi-siddiqui-github/app-one.git
        -- attach origin to your github repo

    git add .
        -- add all files to .git

    git commit -m "update"
        -- commit code changes to .git

    git push -u origin main
        -- push changes to origin at branch main

    git status
        -- check repo status

    git log
        -- check commit history

    git pull
        -- pull latest updates from remote repo

    git remote -v:
        -- check repo remote


Branching and merging:

    git branch feature
        -- create a branch named feature
        -- remember this will create a branch from your current branch

    git branch feature main
        -- more explicit approcah, feature branch is made from main branch

    git checkout feature
        -- switch from current branch to feature branch

    git checkout b1d9a1b9b9e84f374584d6a112ef0961834e0538
        -- our HEAD follows current directory
        -- moves the HEAD to specific commit in history
        -- in order to go back to latest run git checkout main

    git checkout -b bug-fix
        -- -b flag create a branch and switches to it

    git push --set-upstream origin feature
        -- upstream branch is a remote branch that our local branch tracks
        -- through this we push a local feature branch to origin remote repo
        -- then we set upstream branch for local feature branch to track remote feature branch

    git push -u origin feature
        -- shorthand to upstream
        -- establishes a tracking relation between local and remote branch
        -- -u will set the upstream between local and remote branch

    gh pr create --head feature --base main  --title "Merging - F/M" --body "Merging feature update into main"
        -- create pr
        -- pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another
        -- pr visually display the diff - difference between the content in source branch to target branch 

    gh pr merge feature --merge --delete-branch:
    gh pr merge 2 --m -d:
        -- mrege pr using branch or id and delete branch local and remote

    git branch -d feature
        -- delete feature branch locally

    git push origin --delete feature 
        -- delete feature branch remotely
